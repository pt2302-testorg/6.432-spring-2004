This course has no required or recommended text. However, the optional reference text (A. Papoulis, *Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes,* McGraw-Hill, third ed., 1991, ISBN: 0070484686) can be used as a supplement to the course notes. This book covers many of the same topics we will, but overwhelming student opinion in the past has been that the book is one they tend to refer to much more after the course than during it for a variety of reasons. While you may well find this book a useful addition to your personal library, we will not assume you have access to the book during the term. Several other texts which may be a useful resource to you are listed below.
